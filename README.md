# Xamarin.Forms.PancakeView
An extended ContentView for Xamarin.Forms with rounded corners, borders, shadows and more!

## Why PancakeView?

In a lot of Xamarin.Forms UI work I do I have the need for a layout/view that I can use that supports gradients, borders, rounded corners and shadows. Since none of the existing Xamarin.Forms controls fit the bill I decided to roll my own. And why is it called a ```PancakeView``` you ask? Well, pancakes are also round, have shadows and have a glorious gradient color. What better fit can you think of?

## How to use it?

At the moment you can simply clone the repository and include the projects in the ```src``` folder in your Xamarin.Forms and Platform projects. However, once the last few bugs are fixed I will look into making it into a fancy NuGet package :)
